Vaibhav Acharya, Dhruv Potdar

We both worked on the majority of the project together. Dhruv focused more on routing table logic, which includes all the calculations dealing with Dijkstra's algorithm. Vaibhav focused more on the communication between nodes through ports and host names. But overall, we both helped each other in everything and worked together on the entire project.
